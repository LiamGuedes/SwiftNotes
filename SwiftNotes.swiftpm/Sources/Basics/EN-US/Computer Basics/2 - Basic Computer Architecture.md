## 🖥️ Basic Computer Architecture

To understand what happens when a program runs — even a simple "Hello, world!" — it helps to know what's going on inside the machine. A computer isn’t just a single “brain,” but rather a **complex system** made up of interconnected components, each with a specific job.

Understanding these components and how they interact is key to building mental models that will guide you as a programmer, especially when dealing with performance, memory, or even bugs.

### 🧠 CPU – The Brain of the Computer

The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is often referred to as the brain of the computer. It’s responsible for executing instructions — one at a time — in a fast and repetitive cycle.

This cycle is commonly broken into three stages:

- **Fetch**: The CPU fetches the next instruction from memory.  
- **Decode**: It interprets what the instruction is supposed to do.  
- **Execute**: It performs the action — whether it's a calculation, memory access, or control instruction.

This loop happens **millions (or even billions) of times per second**, and is what allows a program to "run."

🧬 CPUs are composed of **cores**, which can run tasks in parallel. Most modern machines have multi-core processors (dual-core, quad-core, or more), which improves performance by handling multiple operations simultaneously.

### 🧩 Memory: RAM, Registers and Cache

To execute instructions, the CPU needs data — and fast access to it. That’s where **memory** comes into play, in multiple levels:

#### 1. **Registers**  
These are tiny, ultra-fast memory slots **inside the CPU itself**. They store the most immediately needed data, like current instruction values or temporary results. Registers are the fastest memory but also the most limited (just a few dozen in most CPUs).

#### 2. **Cache Memory**  
Cache sits **between the CPU and RAM** and serves as a high-speed buffer. It stores frequently accessed data to reduce the time it takes to fetch them from RAM. Cache is faster than RAM but slower than registers, and typically comes in levels (L1, L2, L3).

#### 3. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
This is the computer’s **main memory**. It holds the active parts of the operating system, running programs, and current data. RAM is **volatile**, meaning it loses its contents when the system is turned off. It's slower than cache, but much larger in capacity.

🔄 When the CPU needs data, it looks first in the registers, then in the cache, and finally in RAM. The closer to the CPU, the faster the access.

### 💾 Storage: HDs, SSDs and Beyond

While RAM is temporary, long-term data is stored in **persistent storage** — usually hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs).

- **HDDs** use spinning disks and magnetic heads. They offer large capacity at a lower price but are relatively slow.

- **SSDs** use flash memory and have no moving parts. They are **significantly faster** (especially for reading and booting) but usually cost more per gigabyte.

The operating system loads data from storage into RAM when you open an app or file. Then, the CPU processes the data in memory — never directly from the disk.

### 🔌 Bus System – How Components Communicate

The **bus** is the communication system that transfers data between different components inside the computer — like a data highway.

There are different types of buses:

- **Data bus**: Carries the actual data  
- **Address bus**: Carries memory addresses  
- **Control bus**: Carries signals that manage operations (e.g., read/write instructions)

Everything — from keyboard input to memory writes — travels over these buses. The bus width (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) defines how much data can be transferred at once, directly impacting performance.

### 🏷️ 32-bit vs. 64-bit Architectures

When you hear terms like **32-bit** or **64-bit**, they usually refer to:

- The width of the CPU’s **registers**  
- The size of **memory addresses** the CPU can handle  
- The amount of data processed per instruction cycle

A 32-bit processor can address up to **4 GB of RAM** (2³² bytes), while a 64-bit processor supports **much more** (2⁶⁴ bytes — theoretical limits beyond what most systems need).

Modern operating systems and processors are almost entirely 64-bit, enabling higher performance, memory capacity, and software compatibility.
